About:

Evolve was started to be a nice simple admin mod. As of May 1st, 2012 Overv the original author abanoned this project along with a few others. See the forum thread: http://www.facepunch.com/threads/1167951

Hoever, the GitHub at https://github.com/maddog986/Evolve will continue Evolve and keep it updated and fix any issues that may come up. Many admins still use Evolve and want to see it continue.
People are welcome to submit bug fixes, contribute, and create addons through branches.
